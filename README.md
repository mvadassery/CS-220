CS-220

Projects completed in Javascript

These are all projects made from scratch and completed in Javascript during my course in COMPSCI 220, Programming Methodology. These projects were completed on Ocelot.

JSON.js contains a program that takes in a large dataset of JSON objects, containing dictionaries, arrays, strings, and numbers. Using the fluent design pattern, the program returns a data set based on the user's preferences. 

Series.js features a variety of functions that perform arithmetic operations on finite or infinite sequences (streams) of polynomial coefficients. Using mementos, some of the operations available are adding or multiplying two polynomial streams, obtaining the derivative of the power series, returning the Taylor series, and more.
